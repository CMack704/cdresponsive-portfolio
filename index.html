                <p class="about">Hello! I am from Belmont, NC. I graduated from South Point high school in Belmont.
                     I decided then to go into retail sales instead of going to college. I have been in retail for 18 years mainly between Best Buy and T-Mobile.
                      I am always trying to learn something new. I started messing around on code academy and thought I would like to do this for a profession, 
                      and now here I am starting a new journey!
                </p>
                <p class="about"> I currently live in Gastonia, NC, with my dog Homie.  I am currently a mobile expert with T-Mobile.  I have been at T-Mobile 
                    for 10 years.  I love the company, but as I said before I have been in retail for a long time.  I am ready for a new chapter in my life.  
                    That is what brought me to the coding boot camp at UNC-C.  Hobbies I enjoy are gaming, sports, yoga, and reading.
